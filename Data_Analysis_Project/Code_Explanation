STEP 1: Import necessary Libraries:
Pandas:
Purpose: Pandas are used for data manipulation and analysis.
Explanation: It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, making it easy to work with and analyze structured data.

NumPy:
Purpose: NumPy is used for numerical and mathematical operations.
Explanation: It provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions, which are fundamental for data computations.

Matplotlib:
Purpose: Matplotlib is used for creating static and interactive visualizations.
Explanation: The "pyplot" module in Matplotlib offers a flexible way to create various types of plots, charts, and graphs for data visualization.

Seaborn:
Purpose: Seaborn is used for creating aesthetically pleasing statistical visualizations.
Explanation: Seaborn simplifies the process of creating complex statistical plots and provides a high-level interface to customize and style visualizations for
data exploration and presentation.

STEP 2: Data Preprocessing:
Loading data from a CSV file and performing initial data exploration (checking shape, data types, and missing values).
Dropping unnecessary columns ('Status' and 'unnamed1') and removing rows with missing values.
Converting the 'Amount' column to an integer data type.

STEP 3: Performing Exploratory Data Analysis:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Gender:
    Creating a countplot to visualize the distribution of genders.
    Calculating the total sales ('Amount') by gender and creating a barplot.

2. EDA on Age Group:
    Creating a countplot to visualize the distribution of age groups, differentiated by gender.
    Calculating the total sales ('Amount') by age group and creating a barplot.
    Output: Most buyers are females in the age group 26-35.

3. EDA on Total Number of Orders from Top 10 States:
    Grouping data by 'State,' calculating total orders, and selecting the top 10 states with the most orders.
    Creating barplots to visualize these states' total orders and total sales ('Amount').
    Output: Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have the most orders and total sales.

4. EDA on Marital Status:
    Creating a countplot to visualize the distribution of marital status.
    Calculating the total sales ('Amount') by marital status, differentiated by gender.
    Output: Married women have a higher purchasing power.

5. EDA on Occupation:
    Creating a countplot to visualize the distribution of occupations.
    We are calculating the total sales ('Amount') by occupation and selecting the top 10 occupations.
    Output: Buyers working in the IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors make more purchases.

6. EDA on Product Category:
    Creating a countplot to visualize the distribution of product categories.
    Calculating the total sales ('Amount') by product category and selecting the top 10 categories.
    Output: Food, Clothing, and Footwear are the top-selling product categories.

Conclusion:
Married females aged 26-35 from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, primarily working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors, 
are more likely to buy products from the Food, Clothing, and Electronic categories.
